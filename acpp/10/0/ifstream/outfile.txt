Subject : PF Contribution withdrawal from A/c#PY/BOM/0060305/000/0000062

Dear Sir/Madam,

  I have been unemployed since 6th of April 2015 (more than 1 year
as of 20th Jun 2016) after I resigned from employment with
Arista Networks India Ltd in order to take care of my ailing father;
which makes me eligible for PF withdrawal.

  The contribution to my PF a/c spans more than 5 yrs of service making
it eligible for tax free treatment. This includes the contributions
made during:-
1. Service period of 12+yrs from 2000 to 2013
   (at Tejas Networks India Ltd)
   PF A/c BG/BNG/0024978/000/0000014 transferred to
   current PF A/c PY/BOM/0060305/000/0000062
2. Service period of 1yr 9months from 2013 to 2015
   (at Arista Networks India Pvt Ltd)
   PF A/c PY/BOM/0060305/000/0000062

   Please do the needful to release all the funds accrued in my PF a/c
and have it deposited to my bank a/c as per the details in attached
Form-19 and Form-10C.
                            Thanking you
20th Jun 2016                                           Yours faithfully,

                                                        9448479384
